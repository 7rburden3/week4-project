# Week 4 Solo Project - Record Store

Create an app to demonstrate OOP using Ruby, Test Driven Development, Web Programming (REST, MVC) and interaction with a PostgreSQL database.
The app is to be created using only HTML/CSS, Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL.

## Brief - Record Store

The owner of a Record Store wants an app which will help to keep on top of the store inventory. This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

You could also twist this brief for another kind of store if you wish.

MVP:
Create albums with the quantity that are in stock
Create artists
Show an inventory page listing albums and artists
Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
Possible Extensions:
Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page
Add a genre to an Album
Any other ideas you might come up with
